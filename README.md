# Crypto Investments

* Proposal of a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios that are based on cryptocurrencies. Instead of basing it on only returns and volatility, it will be included other factors that might impact the crypto marketâ€”leading to better performance for your portfolio.

* Development of prototype for submitting your crypto portfolio proposal to the company board of directors.


## Technologies

This project was developed with python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - Providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with "relational" or "labeled" data both easy and intuitive.

* [HoloViz (formerly PyViz)](https://pypi.org/project/hvplot/) - Data visualization tools hvPlot and GeoView.

* [Pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - The pathlib is a Python module which provides an object API for working with files and directories. The pathlib is a standard module. Path is the core object to work with files.

* [SKLearn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) - SPython module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

Also, I used [Jupyter Lab](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) notebook to develope it.
